        "Check out new arrivals, get to know us and see what we’re doing: https://www.instagram.com/govinylgo\r\n\r\nLooking to purchase The Best Record Mailer ever? Send us a message!\r\n\r\nMost orders ship within 3 business days*. But sometimes we make magic happen!\r\n\r\n*(If your order falls on a Thursday, it may not ship until Monday. Please keep this in mind when placing your order or asking about order status. We try to respond to questions on weekends, but we are a business that operates on business days, so please do not panic if you do not hear a response over the weekend.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC (U.S.) SHIPPING RATES (Please review additional information in the \"Shipping Details\" section below)\r\n\r\nUSPS Priority Mail* (About 2 - 3 business days, depending on location): $13 plus $2 per LP. Request quote for orders of 3 or more albums. Priority cost may be more for California, Alaska and Hawaii.\r\n\r\nMedia Mail (2 - 8 business days): $6 for unlimited items!\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING (First Class International)\r\nOne or two 7\" records or CD's shipped alone - $19\r\nUp to 2 lbs (approximately 1 - 2 LPs)* - $33\r\n2 - 3 lbs (approximately 3 - 4 LPs)* - $44\r\n3 - 4 lbs (approximately 4 - 5 LPs)* - $60\r\nPriority Mail International (anything over 4 lbs) - starts at $69\r\n\r\nCANADA\r\nOne or two 7\" records or CD's shipped alone - $15\r\nUp to 2 lbs (approximately 1 - 2 LPs)* - $26\r\n2 - 3 lbs (approximately 3 - 4 LPs)* - $37\r\n3 - 4 lbs (approximately 4 - 5 LPs)* - $48\r\nPriority Mail International (anything over 4 lbs) - starts at $54\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS FEES FOR ORDERS SHIPPING TO CANADA: Items shipping First Class (anything under 4 lbs in weight) can have pre-paid Duties and Taxes fees. Cost is a flat rate of $7. Please make a note with your order if you'd like this cost added. \r\n\r\n*International shipment cost is based on weight. These are general quotes and some releases may weigh more and require additional shipping cost (i.e. MOFI, 180 gram, 200 gram). Anything over 4 lbs in weight will be shipped Priority Mail International. \r\n\r\nInternational buyers: Please do not place an order if you plan to ask us to declare a lower customs value. We will not.\r\n\r\nFirst Class international shipments include a U.S. Customs tracking number, which will track until the time that it is scanned with the U.S. Customs Department. From that point, it may or may not be scanned again when it arrives in your country. The only way to purchase an actual tracking number is by shipping Priority Mail International. This tracking number would track the entire delivery. If you choose First Class International shipping, there are no updates that we can provide beyond what the U.S. Postal Service provides online. We do not issue refunds for an item that is in transit. That item will need to be returned to us before any refunds are issued. International transit time can vary from two weeks to three months delivery time.\r\n\r\nWE SHIP TO YOUR PAYPAL SHIPPING ADDRESS. Please be sure that your PayPal address is the correct shipping address BEFORE SUBMITTING PAYMENT and matches your Discogs address. Please take the extra moment to do this before you submit payment (it cannot be done after the payment is already submitted). It will delay your order if the PayPal address isn't the correct shipping address. Instructions can be found here: https://www.paypal.com/selfhelp/article/FAQ1113. PayPal provides order protection for buyers and sellers and they require that we ship to the address you provide when you submit payment.\r\n\r\nALL BUYERS: We'll add a poly sleeve for an additional $0.50 (will be added into the shipping cost). This is recommended if you request that we ship the LP's outside of the outer sleeve. We have 7\", 10\", 12\" and box set poly sleeves. Also available are Mobile Fidelity anti-static inner sleeves for $0.50/each.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING DETAILS:\r\nMost shipments are packed in our custom record mailers, which are designed to protect the corners of the LP's. Cardboard inserts are used, if needed. See our mailers here: https://www.instagram.com/p/CY8DgxMscuA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\r\n\r\nLarger orders will be packed appropriately with bubble wrap, inserts, or double boxing (we do what will best protect your particular albums). Packaged and shipped with LOVE! On occasion, items are mass listed as sealed that do not come from the manufacturer that way. We ship everything to you as received from the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nShipping insurance is available for all orders (domestic and international). Please ask for a quote when you place the order. Cost is based on the value of the shipment and is determined by USPS.\r\n\r\nMedia Mail is the most cost-effective shipping option for heavier music orders. Please note that all purchases made with Media Mail service are subject to inspection by USPS and cannot be guaranteed against damage or loss. While shipping issues (loss, damage) are rare with all USPS services, if you are a collector we recommend shipping Priority Mail.\r\n\r\nIf you have a question regarding your order, please send us a message on the order page so we will know what you ordered. Please do not email us directly, as the messages sometimes don't come through properly. \r\n\r\nORDER EXTRAS:\r\nIf you're ordering a gift and would like a hand written note, drawing, wrapping paper, or anything else to be added inside, we are happy to accommodate! While we're not artists, we can add a little something to personalize your gift! Just make a note with your order with details regarding what you need. \r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\nWe will accept returns within 7 days for a refund on the cost of the record(s). The record(s) must be in the same condition that you received it. We will not refund shipping costs. \r\n\r\nIf a shipment is returned to us by the post office, you will be responsible for paying the additional postage to re-send the shipment. It’s important to confirm that your PayPal and Discogs shipping addresses are accurate and up-to-date.\r\n\r\nCOLORED LP's:\r\nWe do not guarantee the color of LP's on sealed records (unless a hype sticker is present). We can open records prior to shipping to check color. If this is requested, we will include a free poly sleeve for protection during shipping.\r\n\r\nNUMBERED RECORDS:\r\nUnless noted in the item description, we do not tell what specific numbered copies we have of an item. We have a moving inventory and cannot guarantee we will still have or will pack the specific number that was quoted.\r\n\r\nDAMAGED ITEMS:\r\nWe do not cover seam splits, as we are happy to ship records outside of the sleeve. Please request this if you are concerned about splitting. This is recommended, especially with Mobile Fidelity and Music on Vinyl releases. Additionally, we do not grade shrink condition or presence of hype stickers. Shrink can tear slightly during storage or transit and hype stickers are applied by the record labels and are sometimes not present on all copies of a certain release.\r\n\r\nDEFECTIVE ITEMS:\r\nWe cannot cover warped albums as warping doesn't affect play. If you are concerned with warping, we can open your items prior to shipping to verify that they are not warped. If they are, we can get a replacement prior to shipping to you. \r\nIf you are planning to use an Audio Technica, Victrola or Crosley: please do your research before ordering records. 100% of \"defective\" records we receive from users of these turntables are not defective at all and will play properly when test played. Please expect these issues when you are using a turntable without the option to adjust the weighting. \r\n\r\nPlease note that defects on new and sealed items are rare. Most can be corrected by a turntable adjustment.\r\n\r\nAll issues must be handled within 30 days of receipt of records.\r\n\r\nInternational Buyers - IMPORT DUTIES / TAXES:\r\nImport duties, taxes, and charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost. These charges are the buyer's responsibility. Please check with your country's customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to buying. All purchased items will be declared at their actual value. *Please do not place an order if you plan to ask us to declare a lower customs value. We will not.*",

        '[u][b]INFORMATION ABOUT SHIPMENTS AND CORONAVIRUS[/u][/b]\r\nOur physical store is currently closed. Our online shop is still open. Orders may take a little longer to be processed. Due to increased mail flow customers are reporting stand stills in tracking - if this occurs you must contact USPS and reference your tracking number if you need further information about the delay.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Important Information![/u][/b]\r\n⋆ PLEASE [b][u]DO NOT[/u] LEAVE US INSTRUCTIONS IN THE "ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS" AREA[/b]! WE WILL MOST LIKELY NOT SEE THIS DUE TO AUTOMATIC INVOICING AND DISCOGS DOES NOT LET US KNOW IF A BUYER LEAVES ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS AREA. [b]IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS PLEASE [u]SEND US A MESSAGE OR POST THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE ORDER PAGE TIMELINE[/u][/b] ⋆\r\n\r\n♪♬ We are a record shop and stock thousands of titles. All of our stock is assumed to be M/M (excluding items graded less than M/M) since all of our stock is brand new and shipped directly from major labels to our warehouse. If you are concerned about the grading of an album please contact us before purchasing so we may inspect the album for you. We are always happy to inspect the sleeve carefully to insure it is indeed mint. ♫♩\r\n\r\n[u][b]Office Hours:[/u][/b]\r\nMon-Fri 8:30AM - 4PM\r\nSat-Sun CLOSED\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[b]GENERAL INFORMATION:[/b]\r\n• Payment is expected to be made as soon as possible, we prefer is payment is made immediately as items for unpaid orders will not be held and may sell out in the meantime. Auto-cancellation will occur if an order is not paid for within 4 days. If an order is auto-cancelled due to non-payment you may contact us, we are happy to open the order back up.\r\n• Orders usually ship in 1-2 business days. Larger orders take a bit more time to process and may ship in 2-3 business days. [b]If your order is a gift or you need it to be delivered quicker than Media Mail[/b], please let us know upon placing the order so we may accommodate your needs accordingly.\r\n• We cannot be held responsible for theft - if theft occurs you must contact USPS and/or the police.\r\n• We cannot be held responsible if a package is marked as "Return To Sender" but does not return to us.\r\n• If you do not pay to insure your package we cannot be held responsible for damage that occurs in transit. Insurance must be requested upon placing your order.\r\n• We do our best to make sure our items are listed under the correct version page. If an item is received and is the incorrect version we will pay for the item to be returned and issue a full refund if we are not able to acquire the version purchased.\r\n• Some labels have begun to discontinue including CDs and digital downloads with their LPs. If the CD or digital download code is important please let us know so we may verify that it is still included. This mostly occurs in older releases, so if the release you are interested in is fairly new it should not be an issue.\r\n• Record Store Day items are limited to one copy per customer.\r\n• [b]By placing an order with us you agree to our seller terms. [/b]\r\n\r\n[b]RETURNS:[/b]\r\n• If you change your mind about your order we will accept a return. The album(s) must be unopened and returned to us in the condition it was received. The return must be initiated within 14 days of receiving the purchase. Upon receiving the album(s) back we will refund you the cost of the order less the shipping charge.\r\n• If a record is defective you may contact us to see about a replacement or refund. Returns for defective merchandise must be initiated within 14 days of receiving the purchase. Depending on the situation, we may be able to process an exchange, but if not then a return and refund will most likely be what is settled upon. Vinyl can be a finicky and inconsistent format and we hope that buyers understand that and work with us as well.\r\n• We will work with our customers to keep them satisfied if damage does occur in transit - but please keep in mind that if you are concerned about the condition of the albums(s) you\'ve ordered we do offer an option for more secure shipping (double box) for a nominal charge of $2, or if your order is over $50 it is complimentary.\r\n\r\n✌💖',

Geltungsbereich[/b]\r\n1.1 Vertragspartner ist die hhv.de Handels GmbH, vertreten durch den Geschäftsführer Thomas Ulrich, Zur Alten Börse 55, 12681 Berlin, Deutschland (nachfolgend „hhv.de“ genannt), die über den „Marktplatz“ der Handelsplattform Discogs (nachfolgend „Discogs“ genannt) neue und gebrauchte Waren an Verbraucher und Unternehmer (nachfolgend „Kunde“ genannt) verkauft.\r\n\r\n1.2 Verbraucher ist jede natürliche Person, die bei hhv.de zu einem Zweck einkauft, der überwiegend weder ihrer gewerblichen noch selbständigen beruflichen Tätigkeit zuzurechnen ist. Unternehmer ist jede natürliche oder juristische Person oder rechtsfähige Personengesellschaft, die beim Abschluss des Vertrags in Ausübung ihrer gewerblichen oder selbständigen beruflichen Tätigkeit handelt.\r\n\r\n1.3 Die vorliegenden AGB sind Vertragsbestandteil und gelten für alle, somit auch zukünftigen Verträge zwischen hhv.de und dem Kunden, die über die Handelsplattform Discogs geschlossen werden. Die AGB werden vom Kunden in vollem Umfang in der zum Zeitpunkt des jeweiligen Vertragsschlusses geltenden Fassung akzeptiert. Die vorliegenden AGB gelten ausschließlich: davon abweichenden Regelungen bzw. etwaigen AGB des Kunden wird hiermit widersprochen. Diese AGB sind jederzeit auf Discogs in der Artikelansicht durch Anklicken des Verkäufernamens auf einer separaten Unterseite [url=https://www.discogs.com/user/www.hhv.de]https://www.discogs.com/user/www.hhv.de[/url] oder auf Übersichtsseiten unter dem Link „Verkäuferinformationen, Impressum, AGB, Widerrufsrecht“ einsehbar und ausdruckbar.\r\n\r\n[b]2. Vertragsschluss[/b]\r\n2.1 Discogs erlaubt Drittanbietern, wie hhv.de, ihre Produkte auf Discogs zu listen und zu verkaufen. Discogs ist im Hinblick auf die hhv.de-Angebote nicht Verkäufer der Artikel, sondern stellt lediglich die Dienste und Funktionen zur Verfügung, um mittels der Discogs-Handelsplattform Verträge abzuschließen. Ein Kaufvertrag kommt nur zwischen hhv.de und dem Kunden zustande. Für die von hhv.de bei Discogs gelisteten Artikel erfolgt mit anderen Worten der Verkauf und Versand ausschließlich durch hhv.de.\r\n\r\n2.2 Mit dem Einstellen von Ware mittels der Discogs-Dienste durch hhv.de ist noch kein verbindliches Angebot zum Abschluss eines Kaufvertrages über diese Ware zum angegebenen Kaufpreis verbunden.\r\n\r\n2.3 Der Kunde gibt vielmehr das Angebot zum Kauf ab, indem er die Bestellung bei Discogs abschließt. Der Kunde kann den ausgewählten Artikel zum einen durch Anklicken des Buttons „In den Korb“ in einen virtuellen Warenkorb legen. Zum Abschluss der Bestellung muss der Kunde sich insbesondere in sein Discogs-Kundenkonto einloggen oder über eine Registrierung bei Discogs seine Käuferinformationen angeben und dann auf der Warenkorb-Unterseite von Discogs den Button „Bestellung aufgeben“ anklicken. Damit gibt der Kunde ein verbindliches Angebot zum Kauf der im Warenkorb befindlichen Waren von hhv.de ab.\r\n\r\n2.4 Der Vertrag kommt erst durch die Abgabe der Annahmeerklärung durch hhv.de zustande. Diese Erklärung erfolgt innerhalb von fünf Tagen entweder mit Übersendung einer gesonderten E-Mail oder mit Versand der bestellten Ware. Ansonsten kommt kein Kaufvertrag zustande. Über Produkte aus ein und derselben Bestellung, die nicht an den Kunden versendet werden können oder die nicht in der Annahmeerklärung aufgeführt sind, kommt kein Kaufvertrag zustande.\r\n\r\n2.5 Der Vertragstext wird von uns gespeichert und dem Kunden nach Vertragsschluss nebst den rechtswirksam einbezogenen AGB per E-Mail zugesandt.\r\n\r\n[b]3. Preise, Zahlung, Zahlungsarten, Aufrechnung, Zurückbehaltungsrecht[/b]\r\n3.1 Es gelten die zum Zeitpunkt der Bestellung auf Discogs angegebenen Preise. \r\n•\tBei Ware, die gem. § 25a Umsatzsteuergesetz (UStG) der Differenzbesteuerung unterliegt (Gebrauchtware) ist die Mehrwertsteuer (Umsatzsteuer) im Kaufpreis enthalten, wird jedoch nach den Vorgaben des UStG in den Rechnungen nicht gesondert ausgewiesen. \r\n•\tBei allen übrigen Waren beinhalten die Preise für Kunden aus Deutschland die gesetzliche Mehrwertsteuer (Umsatzsteuer) ohne etwaige Nachlässe. Die Mehrwertsteuer (Umsatzsteuer) wird in den Rechnungen gesondert ausgewiesen. \r\n\r\n3.2 Sofern landesübliche Einfuhrumsatzsteuern etc. anfallen, sind diese vom Kunden zu tragen. Informationen zu den bei Lieferungen in das Nicht-EU-Ausland zu entrichtenden zusätzlichen Zölle, Steuern und Gebühren finden Sie auf folgenden Internetseiten:\r\n- Informationen zu Zöllen unter http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/index_de.htm\r\n- Informationen zur Einfuhrumsatzsteuer unter http://auskunft.ezt-online.de/ezto/Welcome.do\r\n- Informationen speziell für die Schweiz unter http://xtares.admin.ch/tares/login/loginFormFiller.do\r\n\r\n3.3 Der Kunde ist zur Vorkasse verpflichtet. Sofern der Kunde und hhv.de nichts Abweichendes vereinbaren, ist der Kaufpreis sofort fällig und vom Kunden über die von hhv.de angebotenen Zahlungsarten binnen 5 Tagen zu begleichen. Die Ware wird erst nach Zahlungseingang verschickt. \r\n\r\n3.4 Dem Kunden von hhv.de stehen auf Discogs die Zahlungsarten Überweisung und Paypal zur Verfügung. Zu den angebotenen Zahlungsarten im Einzelnen:\r\n\r\nÜberweisung\r\nDie Überweisung hat auf die bei Vertragsschluss mitgeteilte Bankverbindung zu erfolgen. Etwaig anfallende Transaktionskosten einer Überweisung trägt der Kunde.\r\n\r\nPayPal\r\nBei der gewählten Zahlungsart „PayPal“ erfolgt die Zahlung nach dem hierfür von PayPal vorgesehen Prozedere. Der Kunde muss dafür folge den weiteren Anweisungen auf Discogs bzw. von „PayPal" folgen. Vor dem endgültigen Abschluss einer Bestellung wird der Kunde in einem separaten Fenster durch „PayPal" gebeten, die Zahlung zu veranlassen. Ist dieser Zahlungsprozess bei „PayPal" abgeschlossen, führt der Kunde den eigentlichen Bestellvorgang zu Ende. Sobald „PayPal" den Zahlungseingang an hhv.de meldet, liefert hhv.de die Bestellung an den Kunden aus.\r\n\r\n[b]4. Porto & Versandkosten[/b]\r\nZusätzlich zum Warenwert sind nachfolgende Versandkosten zu entrichten. Dies gilt nur, sofern nicht in dem Angebot bzw. vor dem jeweiligen Bestellabschluss davon abweichende Versandkosten ausgewiesen sind:\r\n\r\nVersandkosten innerhalb der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\r\n3,99 Euro für DHL oder Hermes, 4,99 Euro für UPS\r\n\r\nin alle übrigen Länder\r\nDie Versandkosten für Lieferungen außerhalb Deutschlands sind in unserer Automatic Shipping Policy auf Discogs hinterlegt [LINK] und werden Ihnen im Rahmen des Bestellprozesses für Ihre konkrete Bestellung angezeigt.\r\n\r\n[b]5. Eigentumsvorbehalt[/b]\r\nJede Lieferung erfolgt unter Eigentumsvorbehalt. Erst mit der vollständigen Bezahlung und Übergabe der Ware geht das Eigentum auf den Kunden über. Bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt darf die Ware nicht weiterveräußert, verpfändet, sicherheitshalber übereignet oder mit sonstigen Rechten belastet werden.\r\n\r\n[b]6. Rücktrittsrecht von hhv.de[/b]\r\nFalls bei hhv.de kein Zahlungseingang innerhalb von 14 Tagen nach Vertragsschluss zu verzeichnen ist (siehe Ziffer 3.3 dieser AGB), ist hhv.de zum Rücktritt vom Vertrag berechtigt. Ab Erhalt der Bestellung steht die bestellte Ware anderen Kunden nicht zum Verkauf zur Verfügung. Um die bestellte Ware bei nicht erfolgter Zahlung anderweitig anbieten zu können, muss hhv.de vom Kaufvertrag nach fruchtlosem Fristablauf zurücktreten können.\r\n\r\n[b]7. Lieferzeit, Versand[/b]\r\n7.1 Eine Lieferung innerhalb Deutschlands erfolgt in der Regel innerhalb von 1-3 Werktagen nach Zahlungseingang. Die Lieferzeit für Bestellungen ins Ausland beträgt 2-6 Werktage. Angaben zur Lieferfrist sind lediglich voraussichtliche Angaben und ungefähre, unverbindliche Richtwerte, soweit nicht ausnahmsweise der Anliefertermin explizit verbindlich von hhv.de zugesagt wurde.\r\n\r\n7.2 Sind zum Zeitpunkt der Bestellung des Kunden vorübergehend keine Exemplare des von ihm bestellten Produkts verfügbar, so teilt hhv.de dem Kunden dies in der Annahmeerklärung unverzüglich mit. Ist das Produkt dauerhaft nicht lieferbar, sieht der Anbieter von einer Annahmeerklärung ab. Ein Vertrag kommt in diesem Fall nicht zustande. \r\n\r\n7.3 Sofern nicht anders vereinbart, erfolgt die Lieferung per postalischem Versand ab dem hhv.de-Lager an die vom Kunden angegebene Lieferadresse. Der Versand von Bestellungen erfolgt mit DHL, Hermes, UPS (United Parcel Service Inc.) oder FedEx (Federal Express Corporation Inc.). hhv.de behält sich vor, nach eigenem Ermessen auch andere Unternehmen mit dem Versand zu beauftragen.\r\n\r\n7.4 Soweit eine Lieferung an den Kunden aus Gründen, die in der Sphäre des Kunden liegen, nicht möglich ist, trägt der Kunde die zusätzlichen Kosten für die erneute Anlieferung. Der Kunde hat dafür Sorge zu tragen, dass während der üblichen Geschäfts- und Zustellzeiten eine Zustellung der bestellten Ware an die betreffende Versandadresse möglich ist.\r\n\r\n7.5 Das Versandrisiko trägt hhv.de, soweit der Kunde Verbraucher ist.\r\n\r\n7.6 Die Gefahr des zufälligen Verlustes und der zufälligen Beschädigung geht mit Übergabe der Ware auf den Kunden über.\r\n\r\n[b]8. Entgegennahme der Sendung durch den Kunden[/b]\r\nDer Kunde soll äußerlich erkennbar beschädigte Pakete nicht unbeanstandet annehmen, da dies den Nachweis einer Beschädigung der Sendung auf dem Transportweg zu Lasten von hhv.de erschweren oder ausschließen kann. Deshalb soll der Kunde bei Entgegennahme einer Sendung darauf achten, dass das zugestellte Paket äußerlich unbeschädigt ist. Sollte das Paket erkennbar beschädigt sein und aus diesem Grund eine Beschädigung des Inhalts der Sendung nahe liegen, soll der Kunde dies dem Zusteller anzeigen und den Zusteller einen entsprechenden Vermerk aufnehmen lassen, von dem sich der Kunde einen Durchschlag aushändigen lässt.\r\n\r\n[b]9. Widerrufsrecht des Verbrauchers, Widerrufsbelehrung, Widerrufsformular[/b]\r\n[b]9.1 Widerrufsbelehrung[/b]\r\nVerbraucher gem. Ziffer 1.2 dieser AGB haben bei Abschluss eines Fernabsatzgeschäfts grundsätzlich ein gesetzliches Widerrufsrecht, über das hhv.de nachfolgend informiert:\r\n\r\n[b]Widerrufsrecht\r\nAls Verbraucher hat der Kunde hat das Recht, binnen dreißig Tagen ohne Angaben von Gründen diesen Vertrag zu widerrufen.\r\n\r\nDie Widerrufsfrist beträgt dreißig Tage ab dem Tag, an dem der Kunde oder ein von ihm benannter Dritter, der nicht der Beförderer ist, die letzte Ware in Besitz genommen haben bzw. hat. \r\n\r\nUm sein Widerrufsrecht auszuüben, muss der Kunde uns (hhv.de Handels GmbH, Zur Alten Börse 55, 12681 Berlin, Deutschland, Telefon +493029381240, Telefax +493029381255, service@hhv.de) mittels einer eindeutigen Erklärung (z. B. ein mit der Post versandter Brief, Telefax oder E-Mail) über seinen Entschluss, diesen Vertrag zu widerrufen, informieren. Er kann dafür das beigefügte Muster-Widerrufsformular verwenden, das jedoch nicht vorgeschrieben ist.\r\n\r\nDer Kunde kann das Muster-Widerrufsformular oder eine andere eindeutige Erklärung auch auf unserer Webseite [http://www.hhv.de] elektronisch ausfüllen und übermitteln. Macht er von dieser Möglichkeit Gebrauch, so werden wir ihn unverzüglich (z. B. per E-Mail) eine Bestätigung über den Eingang eines solchen Widerrufs übermitteln.\r\n\r\nZur Wahrung der Widerrufsfrist reicht es aus, dass er die Mitteilung über die Ausübung des Widerrufsrechts vor Ablauf der Widerrufsfrist absendet.\r\n\r\nWiderrufsfolgen\r\nWenn der Kunde diesen Vertrag widerruft, haben wir ihm alle Zahlungen, die wir von ihm erhalten haben, einschließlich der Lieferkosten (mit Ausnahme der zusätzlichen Kosten, die sich daraus ergeben, dass er eine andere Art der Lieferung als die von uns angebotene, günstigste Standardlieferung gewählt hat), unverzüglich und spätestens binnen vierzehn Tagen ab dem Tag zurückzuzahlen, an dem die Mitteilung über seinen Widerruf dieses Vertrages bei uns eingegangen ist. Für diese Rückzahlung verwenden wir dasselbe Zahlungsmittel, das er bei der ursprünglichen Transaktion eingesetzt hat, es sei denn, mit ihm wurde ausdrücklich etwas anderes vereinbart; in keinem Fall werden ihm wegen dieser Rückzahlung Entgelte berechnet. Wir können die Rückzahlung verweigern, bis wir die Waren wieder zurückerhalten haben oder bis der Kunde den Nachweis erbracht haben, dass er die Waren zurückgesandt hat, je nachdem, welches der frühere Zeitpunkt ist. \r\n\r\nDer Kunde hat die Waren unverzüglich und in jedem Fall spätestens binnen vierzehn Tagen ab dem Tag, an dem er uns über den Widerruf dieses Vertrages unterrichtet, an hhv.de Handels GmbH, z.Hd. Retouren, Zur Alten Börse 55, 12681 Berlin, Deutschland zurückzusenden oder uns zu übergeben. Die Frist ist gewahrt, wenn er die Waren vor Ablauf der Frist von vierzehn Tagen absendet. Der Kunde trägt die unmittelbaren Kosten der Rücksendung der Waren.\r\n\r\nDer Kunde muss für einen etwaigen Wertverlust der Waren nur aufkommen, wenn dieser Wertverlust auf einen zur Prüfung der Beschaffenheit, Eigenschaften und Funktionsweise der Waren nicht notwendigen Umgang mit ihnen zurückzuführen ist.\r\n\r\nEnde der Widerrufsbelehrung[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]9.2 Ausnahmen vom Widerrufsrecht[/b]\r\nEin Widerrufsrecht besteht nicht bei Fernabsatzverträgen zur Lieferung von Ton- oder Videoaufnahmen (z.B. CD, DVD, Musik- oder Videokassetten) oder von Computersoftware in einer versiegelten Verpackung, wenn die Versiegelung nach der Lieferung entfernt wurde.\r\n\r\n[b]9.3 Muster-Widerrufsformular[/b]\r\n(Wenn der Vertrag widerrufen werden soll, dann bitte dieses Formular ausfüllen und an uns zurücksenden)\r\n\r\nAn hhv.de Handels GmbH, Zur Alten Börse 55, 12681 Berlin, Deutschland; Telefax an +49 (0)30 29 35 20 55; E-Mail an service@hhv.de:\r\n\r\nHiermit widerrufe(n) ich/wir den von mir/uns abgeschlossenen Vertrag über den Kauf der folgenden Waren: …\r\nBestellt am: …\r\nErhalten am: …\r\nName des/der Verbraucher(s): …\r\nAnschrift des/der Verbraucher(s): …\r\n\r\nUnterschrift des/der Verbraucher(s) (nur bei Mitteilung auf Papier)\r\nDatum\r\n\r\n[b]10. Gewährleistung[/b]\r\n10.1 Wir haften für Mängel nach den gesetzlichen Bestimmungen, soweit die Haftung nicht gemäß dieser AGB ausgeschlossen oder beschränkt ist.\r\n\r\n10.2 Normaler Verschleiß oder Abnutzung der Ware begründen naturgemäß keinen Gewährleistungsanspruch. \r\n\r\n10.3 Bei Reklamationen bitten wir um den Nachweis des Kaufs durch Überlassung einer Rechnungskopie und Zusendung des reklamierten Artikels (gemeinsam mit der Rechnungskopie) an hhv.de Handels GmbH, z.Hd. Retouren, Betreff (Rechnungsnr.), Zur Alten Börse 55, 12681 Berlin, Deutschland.

Diese werden von uns vertraulich behandelt und nach den geltenden Gesetzen – insbesondere der Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) und des Bundesdatenschutzgesetzes (BDSG-neu) – verarbeitet. Mit unseren Datenschutzbestimmungen wollen wir Sie informieren, welche personenbezogenen Daten wir von Ihnen erheben, zu welchen Zwecken und auf welcher Rechtsgrundlage wir sie verwenden und gegebenenfalls wem wir sie offenlegen. Darüber hinaus werden wir Ihnen erklären, welche Rechte Ihnen zur Wahrung und Durchsetzung Ihres Datenschutzes zustehen.\r\n\r\n[b]2.\tBEGRIFFE[/b]\r\nUnsere Datenschutzbestimmungen enthalten Fachbegriffe, die in der DSGVO und dem BDSG-neu stehen. Zu Ihrem besseren Verständnis wollen wir diese Begriffe in einfachen Worten vorab erklären:\r\n\r\n[b]2.1\tPersonenbezogene Daten[/b]\r\n„Personenbezogene Daten“ sind alle Informationen, die sich auf eine identifizierte oder identifizierbare Person beziehen (Art. 4 Nr. 1 DSGVO). Angaben einer identifizierten Person können z.B. der Name oder die E-Mail-Adresse sein. Personenbezogen sind aber auch Daten, bei denen die Identität nicht unmittelbar ersichtlich ist, sich aber ermitteln lässt, indem man eigene oder fremde Informationen kombiniert und so erfährt, um wen es sich handelt. Eine Person wird z.B. über die Angabe ihrer Anschrift oder Bankverbindung, ihres Geburtsdatums oder Benutzernamens, ihrer IP-Adressen und/oder Standortdaten identifizierbar. Relevant sind hier alle Informationen, die in irgendeiner Weise einen Rückschluss auf eine Person zulassen. \r\n\r\n[b]2.2\tVerarbeitung[/b]\r\nUnter einer „Verarbeitung“ versteht Art. 4 Nr. 2 DSGVO jeden Vorgang im Zusammenhang mit personenbezogenen Daten. Dies betrifft insbesondere das Erheben, das Erfassen, die Organisation, das Ordnen, die Speicherung, die Anpassung oder Veränderung, das Auslesen, das Abfragen, die Verwendung, die Offenlegung, Übermittlung, Verbreitung oder eine andere Form der Bereitstellung, den Abgleich oder die Verknüpfung, die Einschränkung, das Löschen oder die Vernichtung von personenbezogenen Daten.\r\n\r\n[b]VERANTWORTLICHES UNTERNEHMEN UND DATENSCHUTZBEAUFTRAGTER[/b]\r\n[b]3.\tVERANTWORTLICHER[/b]\r\nVerantwortlich für die Datenverarbeitung ist: \r\n\r\nUnternehmen:\t\t\thhv.de Handels GmbH\r\nGesetzlicher Vertreter: \tThomas Ulrich (Geschäftsführer)\r\nAnschrift: \t\t\tZur Alten Börse 55, 12681 Berlin\r\nTelefon: \t\t\t+49(0)30 29 38 12 40\r\nE-Mail: \t\t\tdatenschutz@hhv.de\r\n\r\n[b]4.\tDATENSCHUTZBEAUFTRAGTER[/b]\r\nWir haben für unser Unternehmen einen externen Datenschutzbeauftragten bestellt.

Dort unterhalten wir ein Profil mit der URL https://www.discogs.com/de/user/www.hhv.de, auf dem unsere aktuellen Angebote eingesehen werden können. Wenn Sie Tonträger über Discogs bei uns erwerben wollen, müssen Sie sich erst bei der Plattform registrieren. Auf die Datenverarbeitung durch Discogs haben wir keinen Einfluss und sind dafür auch nicht verantwortlich. Informationen zum Datenschutz von Discogs finden Sie in der Datenschutzerklärung der Plattform, die unter https://support.discogs.com/hc/de/articles/360009334513 einsehbar ist. \r\n\r\nWir verarbeiten nur personenbezogene Daten von Ihnen, wenn Sie bei uns einen Artikel kaufen. Wenn über Discogs ein Kaufvertrag über Tonträger zustande gekommen ist, übermittelt uns die Plattform, die von Ihnen angegebenen Käuferdaten (Anrede, Vor- und Nachnahme, Anschrift, E-Mail-Adresse). Darüber hinaus erhalten wir Daten zu erfolgten Zahlungen von Ihnen – von unserer Bank Ihre Bankverbindung bei der Zahlungsart Überweisung, durch den Zahlungsdienst PayPal Ihre PayPal-ID bei der Zahlungsart PayPal.\r\n[b]5.2\tZweck[/b]\r\nDie Datenverarbeitung erfolgt zur ordnungsgemäßen Erfüllung und Abwicklung des Kaufvertrages, insbesondere zum Versenden der bestellten Ware. Darüber hinaus benötigen wir die Daten zu Ihrer Identifikation als Vertragspartner, zur Korrespondenz mit Ihnen, zur Abwicklung von evtl. vorliegenden Haftungsansprüchen sowie der Geltendmachung etwaiger Ansprüche gegen Sie. \r\n[b]5.3\tRechtsgrundlage[/b]\r\nDie Datenverarbeitung ist zum Abschluss und zur Abwicklung des Vertrages nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. b DSGVO erforderlich. Ohne die in Ziffer 5.1 genannten Daten ist uns eine Bearbeitung und Erfüllung des Kaufvertrages nicht möglich. \r\n[b]5.4\tSpeicherdauer[/b]\r\nDie Daten werden von uns gelöscht, sobald sie für die Erreichung des Zweckes ihrer Erhebung nicht mehr benötigt werden. Die im Rahmen der Vertragsabwicklung von uns verarbeiteten personenbezogenen Daten werden bis zum Ablauf der gesetzlichen Aufbewahrungspflicht gespeichert und danach gelöscht, es sei denn, dass wir nach Artikel 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. c DSGVO aufgrund von steuer- und handelsrechtlichen Aufbewahrungs- und Dokumentationspflichten (aus HGB, StGB oder AO) zu einer längeren Speicherung verpflichtet sind oder Sie in eine darüberhinausgehende Speicherung nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. a DSGVO eingewilligt haben.\r\n\r\n[b]5.5 Empfänger und Datenübermittlung in Drittstaaten[/b]\r\nDie uns von Discogs übermittelten Käuferdaten werden ausschließlich von uns verarbeitet und grundsätzlich nicht an Dritte verkauft, verliehen oder weitergegeben. Soweit dies nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. b DSGVO für die Abwicklung von Verträgen mit Ihnen erforderlich ist, werden Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Dritte weitergegeben – insbesondere zur Abwicklung der Lieferung der Ware an ein externes Versandunternehmen (z.B. DHL, UPS oder FedEx). Wir verarbeiten Ihre Daten ausschließlich in Deutschland und der EU. Eine Datenübermittlung in Drittstaaten findet grundsätzlich nicht statt und ist auch nicht geplant.\r\n\r\n[b]IHRE RECHTE[/b]\r\n[b]6.\tBETROFFENENRECHTE[/b]\r\nIm Hinblick auf die oben beschriebene Datenverarbeitung durch unser Unternehmen stehen Ihnen die folgenden Betroffenenrechte zu:\r\n\r\n[b]6.1\tAuskunft (Art. 15 DSGVO)[/b]\r\nSie haben das Recht, von uns eine Bestätigung darüber zu verlangen, ob wir Sie betreffende personenbezogene Daten verarbeiten. Ist dies der Fall, steht Ihnen unter den in Art. 15 DSGVO genannten Voraussetzungen ein Recht auf Auskunft über diese personenbezogenen Daten und auf die in Art. 15 DSGVO aufgeführten weiteren Informationen zu.\r\n\r\n[b]6.2\tBerichtigung (Art. 16 DSGVO)[/b]\r\nSie haben das Recht, von uns unverzüglich die Berichtigung Sie betreffender unrichtiger personenbezogener Daten und ggf. die Vervollständigung unvollständiger personenbezogener Daten zu verlangen.\r\n\r\n[b]6.3\tLöschung (Art. 17 DSGVO)[/b]\r\nSie haben das Recht, von uns zu verlangen, dass Sie betreffende personenbezogene Daten unverzüglich gelöscht werden, sofern einer der in Art. 17 DSGVO im einzelnen aufgeführten Gründe zutrifft, z. B. wenn Ihre Daten für die von uns verfolgten Zwecke nicht mehr benötigt werden.\r\n\r\n[b]6.4\tEinschränkung der Datenverarbeitung (Art. 18 DSGVO)[/b]\r\nSie haben das Recht, von uns die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung zu verlangen, wenn eine der in Art. 18 DSGVO aufgeführten Voraussetzungen gegeben ist, z. B. wenn Sie die Richtigkeit Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten bestreiten, wird die Datenverarbeitung für die Dauer eingeschränkt, die uns die Überprüfung der Richtigkeit Ihrer Daten ermöglicht. \r\n\r\n[b]6.5\tDatenübertragbarkeit (Art. 20 DSGVO)[/b]\r\nSie haben das Recht, unter den in Art. 20 DSGVO aufgeführten Voraussetzungen, die Herausgabe der Sie betreffenden Daten in einem strukturierten, gängigen und maschinenlesbaren Format zu verlangen.\r\n\r\n[b]6.6\tWiderruf von Einwilligungen (Art. 7 Abs. 3 DSGVO)[/b]\r\nSie haben das Recht, bei einer Verarbeitung, die auf einer Einwilligung beruht, Ihre Einwilligung jederzeit zu widerrufen. Der Widerruf gilt ab dem Zeitpunkt seiner Geltendmachung. Er wirkt mit anderen Worten für die Zukunft. Die Verarbeitung wird durch den Widerruf der Einwilligung also nicht rückwirkend rechtswidrig.\r\n\r\n[b]6.7\tBeschwerde (Art. 77 DSGVO)[/b]\r\nWenn Sie der Ansicht sind, dass die Verarbeitung der Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten gegen die DSGVO verstößt, haben Sie das Recht auf Beschwerde bei einer Aufsichtsbehörde. Sie können dieses Recht bei einer Aufsichtsbehörde in dem EU-Mitgliedstaat ihres Aufenthaltsorts, ihres Arbeitsplatzes oder des Orts des mutmaßlichen Verstoßes geltend machen. \r\n\r\n[b]6.8\tVerbot automatisierter Entscheidungen/ Profiling (Art. 22 DSGVO)[/b]\r\nEntscheidungen, die für Sie rechtliche Folge nach sich ziehen oder Sie erheblich beeinträchtigen, dürfen nicht ausschließlich auf eine automatisierte Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten – einschließlich eines Profiling – gestützt werden. Wir teilen Ihnen mit, dass wir im Hinblick auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten keine automatisierte Entscheidungsfindung einschließlich Profiling einsetzen.\r\n\r\n[b]6.9\tWiderspruch (Art. 21 DSGVO)[/b]\r\nWenn wir personenbezogene Daten von Ihnen auf Grundlage von Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO (zur Wahrung überwiegender berechtigten Interessen) verarbeiten, haben Sie das Recht, unter den in Art. 21 DSGVO aufgeführten Voraussetzungen dagegen Widerspruch einzulegen. Dies gilt jedoch nur, soweit Gründe vorliegen, die sich aus Ihrer besonderen Situation ergeben. Nach einem Widerspruch verarbeiten wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht mehr, es sei denn wir können zwingende schutzwürdige Gründe für die Verarbeitung nachweisen, die Ihre Interessen, Rechte und Freiheiten überwiegen. Wir müssen die Verarbeitung ebenfalls nicht einstellen, wenn sie der Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen dient. In jedem Fall – auch unabhängig von einer besonderen Situation – haben Sie das Recht, jederzeit Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten für Direktwerbung einzulegen.\r\n\r\nStand: August 2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',

Die Widerrufsfrist beträgt vierzehn Tage ab dem Tag, an dem Sie oder ein von Ihnen benannter Dritter, der nicht der Beförderer ist, die letzte Ware in Besitz genommen haben bzw. hat.\r\nUm Ihr Widerrufsrecht auszuüben, müssen Sie uns (Günter Henn & Michael Fontana GbR, Heidestr. 152, 60385 Frankfurt am Main, Telefon: 069-94598133, E-Mail: lucky-star-records@gmx.de) mittels einer eindeutigen Erklärung (z.B. ein mit der Post versandter Brief oder E-Mail) über Ihren Entschluss, diesen Vertrag zu widerrufen, informieren. Sie können dafür das beigefügte Muster-Widerrufsformular verwenden, das jedoch nicht vorgeschrieben ist. Zur Wahrung der Widerrufsfrist reicht es aus, dass Sie die Mitteilung über die Ausübung des Widerrufsrechts vor Ablauf der Widerrufsfrist absenden. Folgen des Widerrufs Wenn Sie diesen Vertrag widerrufen, haben wir Ihnen alle Zahlungen, die wir von Ihnen erhalten haben, einschließlich der Lieferkosten (mit Ausnahme der zusätzlichen Kosten, die sich daraus ergeben, dass Sie eine andere Art der Lieferung als die von uns angebotene, günstigste Standardlieferung gewählt haben), unverzüglich und spätestens binnen vierzehn Tagen ab dem Tag zurückzuzahlen, an dem die Mitteilung über Ihren Widerruf dieses Vertrags bei uns eingegangen ist. Für diese Rückzahlung verwenden wir dasselbe Zahlungsmittel, das Sie bei der ursprünglichen Transaktion eingesetzt haben, es sei denn, mit Ihnen wurde ausdrücklich etwas anderes vereinbart; in keinem Fall werden Ihnen wegen dieser Rückzahlung Entgelte berechnet. Wir können die Rückzahlung verweigern, bis wir die Waren wieder zurückerhalten haben oder bis Sie den Nachweis erbracht haben, dass Sie die Waren zurückgesandt haben, je nachdem, welches der frühere Zeitpunkt ist. Sie haben die Waren unverzüglich und in jedem Fall spätestens binnen vierzehn Tagen ab dem Tag, an dem Sie uns über den Widerruf dieses Vertrags unterrichten, an uns zurückzusenden oder zu übergeben. Die Frist ist gewahrt, wenn Sie die Waren vor Ablauf der Frist von vierzehn Tagen absenden. Sie tragen die unmittelbaren Kosten der Rücksendung der Waren. Sie müssen für einen etwaigen Wertverlust der Waren nur aufkommen, wenn dieser Wertverlust auf einen zur Prüfung der Beschaffenheit, Eigenschaften und Funktionsweise der Waren nicht notwendigen Umgang mit ihnen zurückzuführen ist. Ausschluss- bzw. Erlöschensgründe Das Widerrufsrecht besteht nicht bei Verträgen - zur Lieferung von Waren, die nicht vorgefertigt sind und für deren Herstellung eine individuelle Auswahl oder Bestimmung durch den Verbraucher maßgeblich ist oder die eindeutig auf die persönlichen Bedürfnisse des Verbrauchers zugeschnitten sind; - zur Lieferung von Waren, die schnell verderben können oder deren Verfallsdatum schnell überschritten würde; - zur Lieferung alkoholischer Getränke, deren Preis bei Vertragsschluss vereinbart wurde, die aber frühestens 30 Tage nach Vertragsschluss geliefert werden können und deren aktueller Wert von Schwankungen auf dem Markt abhängt, auf die der Unternehmer keinen Einfluss hat; - zur Lieferung von Zeitungen, Zeitschriften oder Illustrierten mit Ausnahme von Abonnement-Verträgen. Das Widerrufsrecht erlischt vorzeitig bei Verträgen - zur Lieferung versiegelter Waren, die aus Gründen des Gesundheitsschutzes oder der Hygiene nicht zur Rückgabe geeignet sind, wenn ihre Versiegelung nach der Lieferung entfernt wurde; - zur Lieferung von Waren, wenn diese nach der Lieferung aufgrund ihrer Beschaffenheit untrennbar mit anderen Gütern vermischt wurden; - zur Lieferung von Ton- oder Videoaufnahmen oder Computersoftware in einer versiegelten Packung, wenn die Versiegelung nach der Lieferung entfernt wurde.\r\n\r\nMuster-Widerrufsformular\r\n(Wenn Sie den Vertrag widerrufen wollen, dann füllen Sie bitte dieses Formular aus und senden Sie es zurück an\r\nGünter Henn & Michael Fontana GbR, Heidestraße 152, 60385 Frankfurt am Main, Telefon: 069-94598133, E-Mail: lucky-star-records@gmx.de)\r\n\r\nHiermit widerrufe(n) ich/wir (*) den von mir/uns (*) abgeschlossenen Vertrag über den Kauf der folgenden Waren (*) ………………………………………………………………………………\r\nbestellt am (*) ………………………………………………………………………………\r\nerhalten am (*) ………………………………………………………………………………\r\nName des/der Verbraucher(s) ……..……………………………………………………………….\r\nAnschrift des/der Verbraucher(s) ………………………………………………………………….\r\nDatum, Unterschrift des/der Verbraucher(s) ______________________________________\r\n(*) Unzutreffendes streichen.\r\n\r\nEnde der Widerrufsbelehrung.\r\n\r\n\r\n*************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n[b]Datenschutzerklärung[/b]\r\n\r\nSoweit nachstehend keine anderen Angaben gemacht werden, ist die Bereitstellung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten weder gesetzlich oder vertraglich vorgeschrieben, noch für einen Vertragsabschluss erforderlich.

        "Everything shipped tracked, no exception.\r\n\r\nWe aren't liable for sealed records that have manufacturing defects. These can be returned to the manufacturer. If you wish to return it to us, we will have to deduct part of the return shipping cost, as well as any paypal fees from your refund. Sorry but manufacturing defects aren't our fault. We're not Amazon, we're a small family business and can't take a return on something because it has some minor crackling, especially if you have a Crosley or Victrola. Please try to understand.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out our sister seller: https://www.discogs.com/seller/angloamericanmcrltd/profile !\r\n\r\n[b][u]CANADIAN BUYERS MUST SELECT THE CORRECT PROVINCE FOR SHIPPING[/b][/u] as prices vary based on province. If you don't, we will request the difference before we can process the order. Sales tax added on checkout, based on where you are.\r\n\r\n[b][u]!!!ATTENTION AMERICANS!!![/b][/u] Despite being next door, your parcels take a long time to get there due to USPS being underfunded. We can't speed it up, so please don't ask where your item is, just be patient and check the tracking.\r\n\r\nFollow us on Tiktok, Instagram, Facebook @KopsRecords , and check us out at kopsrecords.ca\r\n\r\nALSO: We love you all 💛🖤💛 but remember we're a store, so we operate our Discogs 5 days a week during store hours, so please don't message us at 11:30pm asking why your message from 8:15pm hasn't received a response. This won't speed up your order.\r\n\r\nPlease don't message via the website, or Facebook/instagram, etc as these are separate departments who don't deal with our Discogs department and won't know what you're referring to.\r\n\r\nPlease, PLEASE stay patient. We are a small, family business, not Amazon\r\n\r\nWe can't be held liable for items damaged during shipping. You can work with Canada Post to try to get some money back, but once we ship it it's out of our hands.\r\n\r\nWe ship all orders via Canada Post. All International and US orders are sent Tracked by default. Due to Covid, we do not send untracked parcels as we cannot risk anything getting lost in the mail. We do not ship surface.\r\n\r\n[b]WE DO NOT SHIP 7\"s AS LETTERMAIL JUST TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS. DO NOT ASK US TO.[/b] \r\n\r\nPhotos available upon request for items above C$100. We cannot provide sound clips on records under $500\r\n\r\n[b]PICK-UP IN STORE AVAILABLE[/b] however please wait for confirmation that it's arrived. Do not show up and ask where your order is as it may not have been processed yet.\r\n\r\nThanks =)",

        "Buyer pays for all shipping costs. Due to Discogs new shipping requirements (NOV-2020) all shipping prices must be set in advance, making it difficult to price shipping appropriately for larger orders or large items. It is possible, for larger quantity or large item/box set orders, that shipping will be cheaper than what is calculated by Discogs. If you are looking to purchase 5 or more records, or a box set with more than a couple records, please message me first so I can get a custom shipping quote. Again: shipping costs are set in advance but may be cheaper for larger orders if you message me prior to paying the invoice.\r\n\r\nPaypal only is accepted at this time. Please message with questions prior to purchase.\r\n\r\n**Shipping Options:**\r\nStandard domestic US shipping via USPS Media Mail (with tracking).\r\nStandard international shipping via USPS international package (with tracking).\r\n**note that First Class International USPS shipping is not insured by default. I'll take condition pics for all international orders and will not refund for any damage occurred during transit. \r\n\r\n__Please specify upon time of purchase, prior to completing invoice, if another shipping method is preferred or if you require insurance.__\r\nContact me if you want a quote for international shipping. If your country is unavailable, please send a message and an exception may be able to be made.\r\n**Records are normally shipped within 1-3 business days. You will be notified of any delays or exceptions.**\r\n\r\nIn order to save paper, I will not include printed invoices for orders, unless requested at time of order.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me with any questions and thanks for shopping.",

        "[u] [b] SHIPPING TERMS 2022 (updated : 01/01/22) [/b] [/u]\r\n\r\nPlease read carefully the shipping terms [b] before [/b] make an order. Thank you.\r\n\r\n[b] 1) [u] A basic thing [/u] : if you haven't money to pay, don't make an order ! I am literally pissed off people who make an order and say they haven't yet the money. When you go in a shop to buy something, do you say to the cashier you haven't the money to pay ? [/b]\r\n\r\n2) Because I have no time to waste, new Discogs users must contact me before make an order, thank you. I reserve the right to cancel your order in case of non respect of this instruction. Thank you for your understanding.\r\n\r\n3) All sales are final. In case of non-payment after 4 days, your order will be canceled and you will receive automatically a negative feedback as a \"non-paying buyer\".\r\n\r\n[b] 4) Because of the new Discogs automatic shipping policies, Paypal fees are now included in shipping costs : 3,5% (France) / 5,5% (EU and Eastern Europe) / 6,5% (Rest of the world) of the total amount + 0,25€ per transaction.\r\n\r\n5) In case of cancellation of your order after payment AND before its shipment, you will be refunded but the Paypal fees will be kept since they no longer refund them to the seller since mid-2019. Thank you for your understanding.\r\n\r\n6) The shipment of the order will be made only to the Paypal address of the buyer. No P.O. Box. No exceptions. Please check your postal address on Paypal before placing an order, thank you. [/b]\r\n\r\n[b] 7) When an item is sold as \"factory sealed\", I prefer to put the vinyls out of the cover to prevent ringwear and seam split during the shipment. I only make a slight incision on the side of the sleeve and I still leave the plastic paper (with stickers , etc). If you prefer that the item remains sealed, please tell me when placing the order. However, in this case, please note that I couldn't be held responsible for any damage of the record sleeve during the transport. [/b]\r\n\r\n8) [u] Regarding the compact discs [/u] : although the majority of the cds that I sell are new and with a case in a perfect condition, [b] please note that I don't grade the CDs cases [/b]. This means that I cannot be held responsible for any damage caused to the case during shipping. Of course, at the buyer's request, I can ship the CDs without the cases in order to avoid such a thing.\r\n\r\n9) [u] Regarding packaging [/u] : for shipping vinyl records, I only use professional packaging bought on a professional website. These are boxes specially designed for shipping vinyl records. I usually add additional cardboards (at least 3, 4 or 5) to fill the space. Depending on the value of the vinyl or by user's request, I can reinforce the corners with homemade cardboards.\r\n\r\n[b] 10) I don't accept returns. If you don't pick up your package at your post office, postage fees, Discogs and Paypal fees will be retained. [/b]\r\n\r\n11) I'm not responsible for the poor pressing quality of a vinyl record. You must inquire before buying.\r\n\r\n12) [u] In case of loss of your package [/u] : unlike international recorded mail, international packages are always tracked & signed. Insurance corresponding to the amount of the value of the order is automatically subscribed. In case of loss of your package, I will contact the customer service of the French post to request a postal inquiry. It may take up to 40 days to get a response. When your package is officially declared lost (not before), I will send you a full refund on Paypal for your order. Fortunately, such a thing happens very rarely (less than 0.5% of the packages I've sent).\r\n\r\n13) [u] Feedbacks [/u] : in my opinion, feedbacks are useful for other Discogs users to trust a seller. So please leave a feedback once your order is received.

        "Availability:\r\nAll stock shown is also available in our busy shop, so there may be times when items have sold in the shop before being removed from Discogs by the next inventory upload. In these rare instances, we shall endeavour to let you know, and refund your payment, as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe try to maintain the accuracy of the stock list but cannot always guarantee availability of items ordered. Please bear this in mind when ordering from us. \r\n\r\nGrading:\r\nWe use the UK Record Collector guide for grading and convert to the nearest Goldmine grading when uploading. This means that 'EX' becomes 'Near Mint (NM or M-)' and 'VG' becomes 'Very Good Plus (VG+)'. You may see VG referred to in our comments, take it that this will mean 'VG+' by Goldmine standards.\r\n\r\nPlease note that some of our new stock may be opened for display purposes. \r\n \r\nWeekends:\r\nOur mail order department is not generally staffed at the weekend so there may be a short delay in confirming your orders or answering any questions you have. Thanks for your patience.\r\n\r\nQuestions/Offers:\r\nPlease note that we are a busy independent shop and do not always have time to play individual records, take photographs of sleeves etc. We take grading very seriously and stand by our gradings but there are not enough hours in the day to respond to every detailed question, especially for cheaper or in demand items. We generally don't accept offers on items either, sorry.\r\n\r\nAll items can be collected in person from our central Manchester store at 18 Oldham Street. \r\n\r\nPayment should be arranged/received with seven days.\r\n\r\nPaypal Fees: \r\nPlease note, if the buyer chooses to cancel an order and requests a refund, then the buyer is elligible to pay the paypal fees; these fees will be deducted from the amount refunded.\r\n\r\n\r\nShipping:\r\n\r\nWe ship via Royal Mail First Class or Special Delivery for UK orders, and International Airmail or 'Tracked & Signed' anywhere outside the UK.\r\n\r\nAll UK orders totaling the value of £50 or more will automatically be sent using Royal Mail Special Delivery service. This will fully insure your goods and will require a signature on delivery.\r\n\r\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT IF YOUR ORDER IS OVER £300, YOU MAY BE ASKED TO PAY MORE SHIPPING TO COVER THE COST OF INSURANCE WITH A COURIER. WE WILL CONTACT YOU TO LET YOU KNOW IF THAT IS THE CASE.\r\n\r\nALL INTERNATIONAL ORDERS OF £30 AND OVER, PLEASE SELECT TRACKED & SIGNED. IF YOU DO NOT SELECT THIS OPTION THEN WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CANCEL YOUR ORDER AND REFUND YOUR PAYMENT.\r\n\r\nWe always remove records from 12\"/LP sleeves before packing to avoid seam splits, so there's no need to ask for this.\r\n\r\nNote that brand new stock may have been opened as we are a retail shop and sleeves (without the records) have to go out in the racks.\r\n\r\nPOSTAGE RATES: \r\n\r\nUK\r\n\r\n1st 12\"/LP £4.50 Each additional item 75p extra.\r\n1st 7\" £2.00.
